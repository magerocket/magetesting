        		<h4>papertrail</h4>
        		<p>We use Mage Testing to help us see if new website features are broken before implementing on a live site. We use papertrail to help us understand why the new features are broken. Magento generates excellent log and debugging information in several different files. Web servers have additional files with relevant log information. papertrail brings all these files into one easy to use, filterable web based interface.</p>

        		<h4>Magento Connect</h4>
        		<p>Mage Testing includes many free extensions from Magento Connect. Often times these are the most important extensions to test as many will not include support. We see Mage Testing as a critical extension of Magento Connect.</p>
